## Configuring and Using a Bean
Beans in Spring are simple POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) that encapsulate data abstractions in a modular manner. When combined with the IoC (Inversion of Control) container, beans allow for automatic control and dependency management.

In this example application, the necessary beans are related to the service layer. We need to autowire the service layer to all defined controllers to ensure the configured endpoints function correctly.

Some important annotations to keep in mind:

- `@Configuration` annotation
- `@Bean` annotation

```java
@Configuration
public class ServicesConfig {

    @Bean
    public LocationService locationService(LocationRepository locationRepository) {
        return new LocationService(locationRepository);
    }

    @Bean
    public BiomeService biomeService(BiomeRepository biomeRepository) {
        return new BiomeService(biomeRepository);
    }
}
```
- The `LocationService` bean is defined for the `Location` entity.
- The `BiomeService` bean is defined for the `Biome` entity.

## Auditing ??
Data auditing is not implemented in this example. However, in R2DBC, auditing can be enabled using the @EnableR2dbcAuditing annotation along with some functional features of modern Java

## The Spring Framework and Beans:
By leveraging pre-defined components known as beans Spring applications are able to be modularized into systems of interactions and dependencies. When these beans are assembled, they spring (pun intended) into a fully functional application.

## What Are Beans?
The concept of beans isnâ€™t new to Java. However, Spring revolutionizes their usage. In Spring, beans are the cetnral aspect of an application, managed by the Spring container, which is just an abstraction of a strcuture that'll hold data for you, as well as manage them.

In this context beans are nothign more than normal POJO objects that are managed by the Spring container. This management includes handling bean dependencies and their instantiation/life cycles through a process known as Inversion of Control (IoC).

## Inversion of Control (IoC)
IoC is a core principle of Spring. It means that the control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the application code to the Spring container. This leads to more modular, testable, and maintainable code. 
In the context of Spring, the specific form of inversion of control being used is DI, also known as Dependency Injection.

Because of IoC, Spring beans become the backbone of an application. They ensure that dependencies are managed efficiently, promoting a clean separation of concerns and making the overall architecture of the application better.
